Dynamic Virtual Pointer  through Advanced Computer Vision Technologies with Python and OpenCV (CV2) Integration

Our project focuses on utilizing a virtual monitor to facilitate precise mouse control through hand gestures.
By integrating user-specific characteristics and gesture recognition technology, we aim to enhance natural interaction.
This personalized approach not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of interaction but also aims to elevate user satisfaction by providing a more natural and intuitive computing experience.
